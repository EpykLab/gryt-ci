# API Testing Guide

This project includes comprehensive tests for the Fly.io API integration with both unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real API calls).

## Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Fast tests using mocked responses to test business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Slower tests that call the real Fly.io API to ensure end-to-end functionality
